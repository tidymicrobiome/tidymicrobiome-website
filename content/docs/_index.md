Microbiome data analysis is complex and challenging due to its high variability. To address this issue, we present microbiomeDataset, an R package that offers a tidyverse-style framework for organizing and processing microbiome data in a standardized and reproducible manner. The package is compatible with other bioinformatics tools and can easily be integrated into existing workflows. A case study using a public microbiome dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of microbiomeDataset in organizing and processing microbiome data. With its comprehensive and accessible solution, microbiomeDataset is suitable for both novice and experienced R users. A detailed tutorial and case study are available in the Supplementary Materials.
